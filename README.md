openrings
=========

open source "Stargate" ring platform for the Second Life online environment. 

I had personally stopped developing on it in April of 2009 and had passed administration of the project over to another, however I still receive numerous emails regarding it and wanted to restart a place to collaborate on the code.

This first git commit is a snapshot of where I stopped at version 0.64 on 4/27/2009.

There is a 'openRings' group on Second Life, however I have not been on myself in a very long time. Life events have taken my attention back to 'real life'. :)
